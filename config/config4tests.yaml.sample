# This information is used to run the unit tests for the API and scripts.
# BIG NOTE: tests are executed agains the url and api key provided here,
#			therefore do not set this URL to production. Ever.
# NOTE 2:	the tests depend on the information in the database and the
#			groups that API Key user is subscribed to, so they may fail	
#			first. You'd need to change the expected values for some tests.
